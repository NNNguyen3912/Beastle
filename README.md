This game was programmed in C++ using the SFML library. The gameplay revolves around defeating monsters to earn points. The game has no ending â€” the player simply tries to achieve the highest score possible before eventually being defeated.

Controls:
Use the WASD keys to move and press J to attack. The player must hit a barrel, which, when it collides with monsters, grants points. The boss cannot be damaged or attacked.
